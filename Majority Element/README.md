# Majority Element

## Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return *the majority element*.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `&lfloor;n / 2&rfloor;` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1
>**Input**: `nums = [3,2,3]`
>**Output**: `3
`

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>**Input**: `nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]`
>**Output**: `2
`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `n == nums.length`
>
>- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
>
>- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

>[!Todo]- Follow Up
>Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?
